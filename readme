Vivian Ha and Anaika Mehra

Vivian’s contribution: Anaika and I mostly had gone on zoom and
pair programmed for this assignment. I mainly handled formatting
the assignment (bootstrap) and making sure that each table/header/etc
matched the assignment specifications. I additionally handled some
of the error handling in terms of the course table initially popping
up, making sure lineedits worked, and the general testing process
of the assignment. Finally, I handled debouncing/setup in index.
I learned more about javascript, jquery, and bootstrap in this
assignment, especially the differences between
bootstrap and just regular css.

Anaika’s contribution: Vivian and I were pair programming for some
aspects of the assignment. We both also spent individual time looking
through errors, formatting, and attending office hours. I focused on
handling the initial display of classes, details, and errors with the
new technique of generating outputs when user enters data(without the
full formatting) and learned more about javascript and jquery in the
process. I followed the penny program as reference.
I also worked on error handling and focused specifically on the
database errors as we got them wrrong in the previous assignment.
I also did some testing for the programs.

Help received:
Haichen Dong (office hours): We got help from Haichen in understanding
the interaction between jquery and the courses python program. He also helped us with a display error.
Professor Dondero: We got help from Professor Dondero about formatting on ed.
